In this fork I intend to strip the code down to the laser essentials only, fix some bugs, and make useful additions for my personal setup. This isn't intended to be a one-size-fits-all implementation, but if you have a K40 laser with RAMPS 1.4 upgrade, it may be useful to you.

==========================================
Turnkey K40 Laser Arduino + Ramps Firmware
==========================================
An example of this firmware in action : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DKSxDIkqoA

Based off Marlin for 3D printers, for more info see https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin
Original credits for building this firmware from stock Marlin go to THinkscape and Lansing Makers Network and John for help with raster support. 
This firmware is based on their foundation work.

This firmware is designed to be used in conjunction with my Inkscape 0.91 gcode exporter https://github.com/TurnkeyTyranny/laser-gcode-exporter-inkscape-plugin

Safety Warnings
==================
Ensure that the Power Supply 5v rail is connected to RAMPS I2C 5v pin and that the D1 diode is removed from the RAMPS board as shown in the wiring diagram. If this pin is not connected the laser will fire when you disconnect your ramps board from USB power.

Wiring
==================
Wire your RAMPS board to your original laser end stops and laser power supply as shown in the wiring diagram in this repo.


Configuring and compilation:
============================

Install the arduino software IDE/toolset (Some configurations also work with 1.x.x)
   http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

* Download the Marlin firmware to your PC and extract it
   https://github.com/TurnkeyTyranny/buildlog-lasercutter-marlin/archive/master.zip

* Start the Arduino IDE.

    ** Select Tools -> Board -> Arduino Mega 2560    or your microcontroller

    ** Select the correct serial port in Tools ->Serial Port (Usually Com7 or the highest port number)

    ** Open Marlin.ino found in the 'Marlin' directory


* Click the Verify/Compile button

* Click the Upload button
    If all goes well the firmware is uploading and you'll see the led on your arduino flashing wildly.
    The Arduino IDE will tell you when it has finished uploading.

* Utilise my exporter with Inkscape to design your cuts and rasters
    https://github.com/TurnkeyTyranny/laser-gcode-exporter-inkscape-plugin

* Burn your eyeballs out!


Features of this repo:
========================

*   Modified for K40 power supplies that use 'Firing Pin Signal Low' to fire.
*   Design in Inkscape, export to GCode, print!
*   Raster image support, set your own max power level and have all pixel data appropriately shifted for intensity. Defaults to 270dpi
*   Set your own feed rate in mm per minute.
*   Vector cutting of lines and arcs at your given power level.
*   Pulse Per Millimetre cutting of vector lines at your own ppm rate and power - defaults to 60us pulses.

*   RC Servo Support, specify angle or duration for continuous rotation servos.


*LCD Menu:*

If your hardware supports it, you can build yourself a LCD-CardReader+Click+encoder combination. It will enable you to realtime tune temperatures,
accelerations, velocities, flow rates, select and print files from the SD card, preheat, disable the steppers, and do other fancy stuff.
One working hardware is documented here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12663
Also, with just a 20x4 or 16x2 display, useful data is shown.

*SD card folders:*

If you have an SD card reader attached to your controller, also folders work now. Listing the files in pronterface will show "/path/subpath/file.g".
You can write to file in a subfolder by specifying a similar text using small letters in the path.
Also, backup copies of various operating systems are hidden, as well as files not ending with ".g".

*SD card folders:*

If you place a file auto[0-9].g into the root of the sd card, it will be automatically executed if you boot the printer. The same file will be executed by selecting "Autostart" from the menu.
First *0 will be performed, than *1 and so on. That way, you can heat up or even print automatically without user interaction.

*Endstop trigger reporting:*

If an endstop is hit while moving towards the endstop, the location at which the firmware thinks that the endstop was triggered is outputed on the serial port.
This is useful, because the user gets a warning message.
However, also tools like QTMarlin can use this for finding acceptable combinations of velocity+acceleration.
